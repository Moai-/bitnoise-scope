- New mandala, update mandala, delete mandala don't update the state
- On load, select an existing mandala if possible / alternatively, design a "no current mandala selected" screen
- Mandala selection looks like shit 
- In fact, the whole app looks kinda terrible - take out the jokes
- Highlight crashed layer on error
- clear canvas button doesn't work 
- awful mandala/layers state interplay

- additional/customizable seeds (clock, periodic random, smooth random, more websocks)
- implement customizable seed as modifiable code 
- IDs for mandalas and layers to more easily rename 
- documentation, examples, code comments, utility functions (e.g. clamp, hash), more variables (e.g. width/height of canvas)
- some sort of export -- gif, webm
- check possibility of working on mobile
- think about domain-specific language for security

- cheshire cat eyes wandering around the room 
- starry night
- the monk wandering by the sea
- atomic nucleus
- the schematic 
- witchcraft circles
